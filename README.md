# Kidnapped Vehicle Project

The objective of this project is to apply Particle Filter approach for localization of a Kidnapped Vehicle. It has been applied in C++. It can be visualized in the Udacity Simulator during run time.


# Dependencies
1. cmake: 3.5
2. make: 4.1
3. gcc/g++: 5.4
4. uWebSocketIO can be installed by: install-ubuntu.sh

    
Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./particle_filter

Alternatively some scripts have been included to streamline this process, these can be leveraged by executing the following in the top directory of the project:

1. ./clean.sh
2. ./build.sh
3. ./run.sh
